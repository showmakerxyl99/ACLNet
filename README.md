# ACL_Net
HSA,IIMA and DBCL module in ACL_Net

In this study, taking into account the challenges presented by small-sized and easily occluded targets in remote sensing images, along with the substantial impact of background interference, we introduce Attention-Based Contrastive Learning Network(ACL-Net), a metric learning-based network architecture.

The framework leverages the ABFO attention module(including HSA and IIMA module) to locally emphasize target object information and employs the DBCL module to maintain clear boundaries between categories, ensuring distinctiveness among them.
